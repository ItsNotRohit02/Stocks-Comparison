# Stocks Comparer
## How it Works
This program allows the user to compare the stock prices of three different companies.
It uses the yfinance package to retrieve data on the selected stocks and displays the current stock price, 
along with a comparison to the previous day's price. Yfinance allows us to retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance. 

The user can choose to either select the stocks from a list or type in the names of the stocks manually. 
The program also has a slider that allows the user to select the length of time (in years) to use for a comparison graph
of the stock prices. If any of the inputted stock names are not recognized, the program will default to using a 
predefined stock name instead.
